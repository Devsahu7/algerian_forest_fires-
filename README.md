# 🌲 Algerian Forest Fire Prediction using Multiple Linear Regression

This project applies **Multiple Linear Regression** to predict forest fire risk using the Algerian Forest Fires dataset.

The model analyzes multiple environmental and weather-related features to estimate fire weather index and related fire indicators.

## 📌 Project Objective

To build a regression model that predicts fire-related outcomes using meteorological data such as:

- Temperature
- Relative Humidity (RH)
- Wind Speed
- Rain
- FFMC
- DMC
- DC
- ISI
- BUI
- FWI

## 🛠️ Technologies Used

- Python
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
- Jupyter Notebook

---

## 📊 Steps Performed

1. Data Cleaning and Preprocessing  
2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)  
3. Feature Selection  
4. Train-Test Split  
5. Model Training (Multiple Linear Regression)  
6. Model Evaluation (R² Score, MSE, MAE)  
7. Visualization of Predictions
